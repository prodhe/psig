PSIG: Static Image Gallery
==========================

Welcome! This web application will create a stylish showcase for all the photos in a folder of your choice.

Simply select a title for your gallery, type in the path to a folder containing one or more JPEG photos and choose where to save the created showcase.

Once the gallery is created, you don't need a web server supporting PHP to show the photographs. You can upload the final showcase to any server and it will work as intended, as long as the visitor's web browser supports JavaScript.
